# Grovlin - Just another JVM language - My playground

Building an own language I bet is the dream of every programmer who already programmed in a lot of different languages but never was 100% happy with one of them.

In my case I'm nearly 100% happy with Kotlin but missing a bit of the simplicity and java-like syntax of Groovy. After reading the really good blog-series of [Frederico Tomasseti](https://tomassetti.me/getting-started-with-antlr-building-a-simple-expression-language/), I decided
to merge my favorite features of Kotlin and Groovy. So this project was born :).
