# Grovlin - Just another JVM language - My playground
[![build status](https://gitlab.com/arturbosch/Grovlin/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.com/arturbosch/Grovlin/commits/master)

Building an own language I bet is the dream of every programmer who already programmed in a lot of different languages but never was 100% happy with one of them.

In my case I'm nearly 100% happy with Kotlin but missing a bit of the simplicity and java-like syntax of Groovy. After reading the really good blog-series of [Frederico Tomasseti](https://tomassetti.me/getting-started-with-antlr-building-a-simple-expression-language/), I decided
to merge my favorite features of Kotlin and Groovy. So this project was born :).

Antlr -> AST -> Grovlin -> Java -> Bytecode -> JVM

### Build & Run

- `gradle build`
- `java -jar grovlin-compiler/build/libs/grovlin-compiler-0.1.0.jar run [path/to/program.grovlin]`


### Coding exampes v0.1

```
def program() {
    var x = 5
    var y = 4
    print(x + y)
}
```

```
def program() {
    var x = 5
    var y = 4
    y = 10
    x = y + x / 3
    print(x as Decimal + y)
}
```

```
def program() {
    val b = true && true ^ (false ^ true)
    if (b) {
        print(0)
    } elif (!b) {
        print(1)
    } elif (true) {
        print(2)
    } else {
        print(3)
    }
}
```

```
def meaningOfLife(Int number): Boolean {
    return number == 42
}

def program() {
    var answer = meaningOfLife(42)
    print(answer)
}
```

##### Upcoming Type&Object Support

```
type Node {
    def traverse()
}
type Leaf extends Node {
    Int data
    def traverse() {
        print(data)
    }
}
type Tree extends Node {
    Node left
    Node right
    Node parent
    def traverse() {
        left.traverse()
        right.traverse()
    }
}

object TreeImpl as Tree {
    override Node left
    override Node right
    override Node parent
}

object LeafImpl as Leaf {
    override Int data = 1
}

def program() {
    var tree = TreeImpl()
    tree.left = LeafImpl()
    tree.left.data = 5
    var tree2 = TreeImpl()
    tree2.parent = tree
    tree.right = tree2
    tree2.left = LeafImpl()
    tree2.right = LeafImpl()

    tree.traverse()
}
```
